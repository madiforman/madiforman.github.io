    <p class = 'aboutMe'> My name is Madison Sanchez-Forman, but you can call me Madi. I am (currently) a junior in college studying at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington. I was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico where I lived until I was 4. After that I moved to Phoenix, Arizona where I would live until I graduated high school. </p>
    <h3>Special Interests</h3>
    <p class = 'aboutMe'> I have physical disability, caused from damage to my spinal cord from childhood cancer. Because of this, in high-school I competitively raced in adaptive track and field. I threw myself into it and was eventually approached by the United States Paralympic track and field coaches, and brought to California to train with them. However, I would’ve had to define my life around it. I would’ve had to push off school to train and focus, and that didn’t feel like me, so now I practice for fun on our campus track. 
    </p>
    <p class = 'aboutMe'> Outside of that, I am a creative person. I have been drawing and painting since I can remember, and after focusing my studies on computer science, have discovered “creative coding”, and it has slowly been consuming my creative focus. </p>
